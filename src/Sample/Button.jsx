            <h3>A mutant with an unstoppable healing power, adamantium metal claws and no-nonsense attitude makes the man called Logan, one of the most ferocious heroes in the universe.
Wolverine doesn’t play well with others, thus his arc usually involves his struggle to function on a team. He is the perennial loner, a societal outcast with a short fuse who doesn’t suffer fools lightly. 
What makes him such an interesting part of the X-Men team dynamic is what also makes him so dangerous: he’s a wildcard.
